Inference of Gene regulatory networks

## Optimization

The same human cell data can be predicted by DeepLearning networks. In this porject the graph auto encoder DeepRIG will be compared with a transformer model STGRNS.

Both DeepLearning networks optimize its function parameters with the Adam algorithm, approaching the minimal loss through gradient reduction.

DeepRIG calculates the L2-Loss.
STGRNS calculates the CrossEntropy Loss.
